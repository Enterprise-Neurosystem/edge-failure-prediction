Data Prep
    Count nulls per column, display for user
    Drop bad cols based on nulls count
    Change value of "MACHINE_STATUS" to numeric
    Get Failure times for whole data table
    Add target col called "alarm"
    Get df for train, test, val
    Replace NaN with mean for all cols in train, test, val
    Get sensor names (feature names)
    Get scaler for train
    Scale train, test, val
    Get PCA for given number of top columns, gives df_train_pca, df_test_pca, df_val_pca
    Get Ranked features according to PCA
    PCS transform train, test, val data (scaled versions of each)
    Get failure times for train
    Set train_time_window_dimensions = [96*60, 12*60, 12*60, 5] (Start 90 h before failure, stop 12 h before failure
    Get X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, X_val, y_val as ndarrays using df_train_pca, df_test_pca, df_val_pca

Training
    Get input shape from X_train
    Create Model using X_train input shape
    Fit Model with X_train, y_train
    Plot model training history

Test/Val
    Need df_test_pca, df_val_pca, X_val, X_test
        NOTE: Can generate X_val and X_test from df_test_pca and df_val_pca
        by using DataPreparation.timeseries_before_failure()
    Get Failure time for test from df_test_pca
    window_len:  How many time units to use to predict the next output.


Data Needed for Training

    X_train, y_train:  Scaled and PCA
    Learning Rate
    Model: nodes per layer

Data Needed for Testing, Validation
    Failure Time for Test and Val (One for each set), comes from df_test_pca and df_val_pca
    The trained model
    test_time_window_dimensions, val_time_window_ dimensions
